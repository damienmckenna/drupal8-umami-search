# Umami demo search

This project is an implementation of the [Umami install profile](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/umami-drupal-8-demonstration-installation-profile).
It demonstrates  search functionalities that can be achieved with a basic setup of Drupal 8's [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api), [Search API Database Search](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_db) and [Facets](https://www.drupal.org/project/facets).

A demo site is available on [drupalsear.ch](http://drupalsear.ch).

## Installation

The site can be installed locally by running `install.sh` from the project root:

You can quickly test the site using the [Drush runserver command](https://drushcommands.com/drush-9x/core/runserver/):
